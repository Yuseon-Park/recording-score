This website was created to store the recording collections.

================================================================================

I have been recording sound for a long time; the sound of diverse road surfaces and languages changes the basic structure of time and space. In continuously translating each recording at different times, I encountered a completely different reality. Translation of audio into text allows me to give them a different reality again. I wrote to respond to the time and sound of the recording. I liked a lot about this process because of the relationship between the audio and the text.Â
