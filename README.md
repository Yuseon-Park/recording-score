I have been recording sound for a long time; the sound of diverse road surfaces and languages changes the basic structure of time and space. In continuously translating each recording at different times, I encountered a completely different reality. Translation of audio into text allows me to give them a different reality again. I wrote to respond to the time and sound of the recording. I liked a lot about this process because of the relationship between the audio and the text.

What I find powerful about sound is the way in which it leads me to create an image in my mind. When I hear someone use the tool, I can listen to it’s a kettle, what kind of kettle, how far away, where, etc. There’s so much information even in just like half a second, I can tell. And so all the information which is in sound is very complex and rich, and It creates images in one’s mind immediately based on what I hear.

And I think about the discord because this is a kind of one sequence from my voice. So, therefore, I created this Button that allows this sequence to play as random, like other or many voices read the score.

I think there’s also something interesting about the physical process of being able almost to take the website with a listener on a walk. It is like a Walkman here. Mobility suddenly becomes this space where you can have a very individual experience while in the public area or navigating.
